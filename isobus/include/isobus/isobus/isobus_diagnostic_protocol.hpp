/// @brief A protocol that handles the ISO 11783-12 Diagnostic Protocol and some J1939 DMs.
/// @details This protocol manages many of the messages defined in ISO 11783-12
/// and a subset of the messages defined in SAE J1939-73.
/// The ISO-11783 definition of some of these is based on the J1939 definition with some tweaks.
/// You can select if you want the protocol to behave like J1939 by calling set_j1939_mode.
/// One of the messages this protocol supports is the DM1 message.
/// The DM1 is sent via BAM, which has some implications to your application,
/// as only 1 BAM can be active at a time. This message
/// is sent at 1 Hz. In ISOBUS mode, unlike in J1939, the message is discontinued when no DTCs are active to
/// minimize bus load. Also, ISO-11783 does not utilize or support lamp status.
/// Other messages this protocol supports include: DM2, DM3, DM11, DM13, DM22, software ID, and Product ID.
///
/// @note DM13 has two primary functions. It may be used as a command, from either a tool or an
/// ECU, directed to a single controller or to all controllers to request the receiving
/// controller(s) to stop or start broadcast messages. Additionally, it may be used by an ECU
/// to inform other nodes that the sender is about to suspend its normal broadcast due to
/// commands other than a SAE J1939 DM13 command received on that same network segment.
/// The broadcast messages stopped, started, or suspended may be on networks other than SAE J1939.
/// This is not a message to ignore all communications. It is a message to minimize network traffic.
///
/// @attention It is recognized that some network messages may be required to continue even during
/// the "stop broadcast" condition. You MUST handle this in your application, as the stack cannot
/// decide what messages are required without context. In other words, you must opt-in to make
/// your application layer messages adhere to DM13 requests by explicitly calling the functions
/// on this protocol (using get_diagnostic_protocol_by_internal_control_function)
/// to check if you should send it.
