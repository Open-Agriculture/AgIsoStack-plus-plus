/// @brief Defines an interface for sending and receiving ISOBUS heartbeats.
/// The heartbeat message is used to determine the integrity of the communication of messages and
/// parameters being transmitted by a control function. There may be multiple instances of the
/// heartbeat message on the network, and CFs are required transmit the message on request.
/// As long as the heartbeat message is transmitted at the regular
/// time interval and the sequence number increases through the valid range, then the
/// heartbeat message indicates that the data source CF is operational and provides
/// correct data in all its messages.
