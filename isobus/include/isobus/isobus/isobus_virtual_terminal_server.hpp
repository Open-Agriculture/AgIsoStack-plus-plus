	/// @brief This class is an abstract VT server interface.
	/// @details The VT is a control function that provides a way for operators to interact with other
	/// control functions via a GUI. A VT has a pixel-addressable (graphical) display.
	/// The information that is shown in display areas are defined by Data Masks, Alarm Masks and Soft Key Masks.
	/// The data for these masks is contained in object definitions that are loaded into a VT via the ISO 11783 CAN bus, or from non-volatile memory.
	/// See ISO 11783-6 for the complete definition of this interface, and the objects involved.
