	/// @details This class handles transmission and reception of CAN messages up to 1785 bytes.
	/// Both broadcast and connection mode are supported. Simply call `CANNetworkManager::send_can_message()`
	/// with an appropriate data length, and the protocol will be automatically selected to be used.
	/// @note The use of multi-frame broadcast messages (BAM) is discouraged, as it has profound
	/// packet timing implications for your application, and is limited to only 1 active session at a time.
	/// That session could be busy if you are using DM1 or any other BAM protocol, causing intermittent
	/// transmit failures from this class. This is not a bug, rather a limitation of the protocol
	/// definition.
