## In Detail

ISOBUS (based on the ISO-11783 standard) defines how agricultural machinery should communicate with each other on a CANbus network. Cross compatibility is achieved when different manufacturers carefully follow this standard when developing their devices. This means that a tractor from one manufacturer can communicate with an implement from another manufacturer, and vice versa.

AgIsoStack++ provides an easy-to-use interface for your application to communicate on the ISOBUS network in a compliant manner, without the need to worry about the details of the standard.
The library is is written in modern C++11 and uses the STL whenever possible. It is designed to be easy to understand is fully documented.

## Getting Started

Check out the [tutorial website](https://agisostack-plus-plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for information on ISOBUS basics, how to download this library, and how to use it. The tutorials contain in-depth examples and explanations to help get your ISOBUS or J1939 project going quickly.

### Use of our SAE/ISOBUS Manufacturer Code

If you are integrating with our library to create an ISO11783 or J1939 application and are not selling your software or device containing that software for-profit, then you are welcome to use our manufacturer number in your application.

If you are creating such an application for sale as a for-profit company, then we ask that you please obtain your own manufacturer code from SAE instead of using ours.

Our manufacturer code is 1407 (decimal).
