**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Supporting Documentation**
If your issue is CAN behavior related, it may be helpful to have a CAN trace of your issue that clearly shows the undesirable behavior. Please attach one if you think it might help, or if requested. Try to capture address claiming in addition to the bad behavior if possible. We prefer files captured with `candump -l` or `.asc` ascii format log files.  Binary Vector files `.blf` will not be accepted.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**

- OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 20.04]
- Compiler [e.g. GCC 9.4.0]
- CAN Driver [e.g. Socket CAN]

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here that you think might help us recreate or otherwise address your issue if applicable.
