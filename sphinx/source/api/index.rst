.. note::

   This documentation won't cover the complete API, but only the public
   parts of it. Which should be enough for most users.

   The internal parts are documented in the source code itself, and can
   be generated and viewed using Doxygen. More information about this
   can be found in the :ref:`doxygen` section.
